# Blink Project with Arduino

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of blinking an LED using an Arduino board. It begins with controlling the onboard LED and progresses to connecting and blinking an external LED. It's a great starting point for beginners learning microcontroller programming and electronics.

## Overview

The "Blink" project introduces:
1. Controlling the onboard LED present on most Arduino boards (connected to pin 13 by default).
2. Extending the project to control an external LED connected to the Arduino.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- LED
- Resistor (220Ω or 330Ω recommended)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
